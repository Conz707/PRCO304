Final Year Dissertation Project

Nursery System

Final Grade: 71% - First Class Honours

Technologies:

For this project, I decided on using technologies I hadn't used before to challenge myself and further my programming skills. The technologies used were Swift to create the mobile application, MySQL for the database and PHP as the middleware for CRUD operations.  




The System:

This project was undertaken to convert the dated paper-based system nurseries in the UK use for tracking students information, activity,
goals etc with a more modernised electronic system that allows nursery staff to access and update information about students on the move
via a portable device (iPad Mini).

Further functionality was added to create an administrative side of the application for adding new users and students, and a hub for parents
to view their children and receive notifications of any new activity, as well as the ability to view old activity.
