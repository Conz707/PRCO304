Final Year Dissertation Project
Nursery System
Final Grade: 71% - First Class Honours

Technologies: Swift, PHP, MySQL

This project was undertaken to convert the dated paper-based system nurseries in the UK use for tracking students information, activity,
goals etc with a more modernised electronic system that allows nursery staff to access and update information about students on the move
via a portable device (iPad Mini).

Further functionality was added to create an administrative side of the application for adding new users and students, and a hub for parents
to view their children and receive notifications of any new activity, as well as the ability to view old activity.
